# Observable Unity Components

Watchable `MonoBehaviour` and `ScriptableObject` fields thanks to a Custom Source Generator and Roslyn Analyser specifically written for Unity.

## Description

This plugin allows you to get notified whenever the fields of your component are getting modified from anywhehre within the engine, including from animation or from within the editor. No refactoring needed, no need for verbose checks or interface implementation. Just make your `MonoBehaviour` or `ScriptableObject` class partial, add a `[Watch]` attribute to your fields, and then check for `HaveValuesChanged()` in your `Update()` method or anywhere else you like.

## Getting Started

### Unity Version

* Unity 2020.2 minimum

> [!NOTE]  
> Up until Unity 2023.2 the only compatible version for the `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` package is 3.8 and the Unity 6 preview seems to be compatible with version 4.3

### Installing

* Download the .unitypackage from the Releases tab.
* Extract in your Unity project

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This package *must* be installed in the `Assets` folder. Don't try to install this as a custom package; Roslyn Analysers will only work in Unity when using a [special asset label](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/roslyn-analyzers.html), and asset labels don't work in custom packages.

### How to use

* Set your `MonoBehaviour` class or `ScriptableObject` class to partial
* Add a `[Watch]` attribute to any serialized field you want to watch
* Check for `

## Known issues

* IntelliSense may throw an error when trying to access generated identifiers such as `HaveValuesChanged()`. Closing VS and re-opening it might solve the issue.
* The very first call to `HaveValuesChanged()` will always return `true` even if no values have changed yet. A temporary workaround is to add the following code before any calls to `HaveValuesChanged()` is made (but not after!)

```cs
lastHash = GetCurrentHash();
```

> [!TIP]
> `lastHash` and `GetCurrentHash()` are both generated by the Source Generator, there's no need to declare them.

## F.A.Qs

> Why not implement generated properties like the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface in MVVM applications?

This particular plugin is primarily written with Unity in mind. The goal here is to detect changes that happen from anywhere in the engine, including from an Animator or a Timeline component. Since Unity may change a component's fields using its internal serialization process, we cannot expect it to call our generated properties. Using the `HaveValuesChanged()` method is more in line with a regular Unity workflow.
